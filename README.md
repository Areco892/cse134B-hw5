# Alexander Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio GitHub repository. I hope you enjoy your stay and let me know your thoughts on the website, I would like to hear from you! The website is still a work in progress, so stay tuned for future updates!

## Main Pages
The portfolio consists of several pages, listed as follow:
- Home : contains a brief introduction of who I am, as well as a list of my hobbies.
- Projects : contains the projects I have worked on so far.
- Resume : contains my resume with an option to download.
- Contact : contains my socials (LinkedIn, GitHub) and a contact form, if you want to reach out.

## Key Features
- The website includes some transitions you don't want to miss out on! For example, if you navigate between pages, you should be able to see a fade transition between the pages. Also, in the home page, there will be a show and hide details button for the hobbies. Click and see what happens! So, make sure your browser can make use of View Transition API. 
- At the top of each page, there is a theme toggle button that allows you to change the pages' background color, text color, and select from predefined text fonts. There are also default light/dark modes. So, make sure you have JavaScript enabled.
- In the projects page, there will be a preview of all the projects. In order to see more details of each, click on a project to display the project's title, an image of the project, a brief description, and a read more button. If you want to read more about each project, click on the read more button, which should redirect you to the GitHub repository.
